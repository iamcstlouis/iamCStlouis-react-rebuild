                iamCStlouis is a London based artist specialising in portraiture. Through her portraits she is
                able
                to
                capture people at their best and at times even at their worst. Either way her paintings are a
                reflection of what is real, but how she sees it.

                While iamCStlouis has been sketching her whole life with no formal training, she decided to take
                her
                passion for art to the next level in 2013 and in March 2014 she had her first Exhibition. It was
                at
                this exhibition where she gained exposure and as she continues to paint daily, iamCStlouis' work
                is
                now
                collected by many, including football players Wilfred Zaha (of Manchester United FC) and Yannick
                Bolasie (of Crystal Palace FC) and Comedian/(Capital Xtra) Radio presenter, Kojo.

                Working from photographs, iamCStlouis says, “Paintings capture and portray something that
                photographs
                can’t. A photograph will reflect a person exactly as they were, in that exact moment. However,
                it is
                limited to just that, while there are no limitations to how a person is portrayed in a painting.
                A
                person’s emotions in a painting can be exaggerated or even tamed, through the use of colour and
                tones or even simply, through a few spontaneous strokes of the brush”.

                iamCStlouis says, the reaction of her clients when they receive her artwork is priceless and is
                one
                of
                the many reasons her passion for art is ever growing. The feeling of freedom that comes with art
                is
                something that no other career could possibly provide because “… there are no rules and no
                guidelines. Art has no limitations, I simply allow my brush to follow as my mind takes the
                lead”.
